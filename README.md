Hey I'm James! I work as a software developer for [CBRE Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBRE_Group) where I build tools for commercial real estate appraisers. I also run a small consulting firm called [Kanan Labs Ltd.](https://kananlabs.org), though the day job takes most of my time these days.

---

**ðŸ”­ The main project** Iâ€™m currently working on is called Evergreen.
* Evergreen is a multi-purpose application for producing, editing and cataloging commercial real estate appraisals.
* The tool enables on-demand creation of custom valuation models, end-to-end assignment administration and execution, and data persistence.
* I'm also building a delivery and workflow management platform called Landscape.

**ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning** Python and am currently learning-by-doing database administration, more sophisticated application architecture, kubernetes (boo ðŸ‘Ž), and a little bit of rust (yay ðŸ¥³).
* I maintain a python project template called [bulletproof-python](https://github.com/jamwil/bulletproof-python).
* I'm focusing my extra-curricular learning on Rust these days, and away from the computer I'm planning the motorcycle trip of a lifetime from Alaska to Patagonia.

**ðŸ’¬ Ask me about** desktop/enterprise programming (Evergreen is a Qt-based desktop application, unfortunately), interfacing with Microsoft Excel/Word from Python (also gross), and anything tangential to commercial real estate.
