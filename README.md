### Shit. You found me.

Hey I'm James! Tinkering and learning every day. Currently I work for a F500 in the Commercial Real Estate industry. I build tools to help appraisers enjoy their jobs more. I also run a small consulting firm called @kananlabs, though the day job takes most of my time these days.

- ðŸ”­ The main project Iâ€™m currently working on is called Evergreen. Evergreen is a multi-purpose tool for managing end-to-end appraisal workflow. It enables the configuration of template modules, coordinates real-time data sync from Excel to Word, and interfaces with a modern database.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning Python (grug brain) and am currently learning-by-doing database administration, more sophisticated application architecture, docker and modern dev-ops (young grug brain, all). I'd like to learn htmx, Rust and Swift next. Currently reading Fluent Python, 2nd Edition (the 1st Edition changed my life) as well as Architecture Patterns with Python.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about desktop/enterprise programming (Evergreen is a Qt-based desktop application) and anything Commercial Real Estate.
