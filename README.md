Hey I'm James! I work as a software developer and general Swiss Army knife in my role as VP, Digital Operations for [CBRE Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBRE_Group) in Canada. Mainly I build internal tools and solutions for commercial real estate appraisers. I also run small side projects and open source work through my personal organization, [Kanan Labs Ltd](https://kananlabs.org).

---

**ðŸ”­ The main project** Iâ€™m currently working on is called Evergreen.
* Evergreen is a multi-purpose application for producing, editing and cataloging commercial real estate appraisals.
* The suite of tools enables on-demand creation of custom valuation models, end-to-end assignment execution, assignment administration, risk management, and valuation data persistence.
* I also develop and manage financial models for commercial real estate valuation which integrate tightly with the application.

**ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning** Python and am currently learning-by-doing database administration, more sophisticated application architecture, cloud engineering and basic SRE with kubernetes and terraform, and I sneak in a little bit of rust and javascript here and there.
* I'm focusing my extra-curricular learning on Rust these days, including chipping in on the odd open source project, and I'm revisiting fundamental skills by way of [OSSU](https://ossu.dev).
* Away from the computer I'm into adventure motorcycling and have several big trips in the works. I am also learning Spanish, and I love to hike and take any opportunity to get outdoors.

**ðŸ’¬ Ask me about** desktop/enterprise programming (Evergreen is a Qt-based desktop application), interfacing with Microsoft Excel/Word from Python (can be a bit gross), and anything tangential to commercial real estate.
