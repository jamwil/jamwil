Hey I'm James! I work as a software developer for CBRE where I build tools to help appraisers enjoy their jobs more. I also run a small consulting firm called Kanan Labs Ltd., though the day job takes most of my time these days.

---

**ðŸ”­ The main project** Iâ€™m currently working on is called Evergreen.
* Evergreen is a multi-purpose application for producing, editing and cataloging commercial real-estate appraisals.
* The tool enables on-demand creation of custom valuation models, coordinates real-time data sync from Microsoft Excel to Word, and interfaces with a modern database.

**ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning** Python and am currently learning-by-doing database administration, more sophisticated application architecture, and a little bit of rust.
* I have a soft spot for dev ops tools and testing.
* Right now I'm reading Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software, The Rust Book, Architecture Patterns with Python (great book but paused for now after Part I), and Programming from the Ground Up (in assembly of all languagesâ€”haven't started this one yet but I'll get to it after the Rust book).

**ðŸ’¬ Ask me about** desktop/enterprise programming (Evergreen is a Qt-based desktop application, unfortunately), interfacing with Microsoft Excel/Word from Python (also gross), and anything tangential to commercial real estate or database design thereof.
