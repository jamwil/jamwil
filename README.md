### Shit. You found me.

Hey I'm James! Tinkering and learning every day. Currently I work for a F500 in the Commercial Real Estate industry. I build tools to help appraisers enjoy their jobs more. I also run a small consulting firm called Kanan Labs Ltd., though the day job takes most of my time these days.

---

**🔭 The main project** I’m currently working on is called Evergreen.
* Evergreen is a multi-purpose tool for managing end-to-end appraisal workflow.
* It enables the configuration of template modules, coordinates real-time data sync from Excel to Word, and interfaces with a modern database.

**🌱 I’m always learning** Python ([grug brain](https://grugbrain.dev)) and am currently learning-by-doing database administration, more sophisticated application architecture, docker and modern dev-ops (young grug brain, all).
* I'd like to learn htmx, Rust and Swift.
* The technology I'm most excited about is WebAssembly. My next hobby project will likely be Rust/WASM-based.
* I like tools and spend too much time on tooling and not enough time coding.
* Currently reading Fluent Python, 2nd Edition (the 1st Edition changed my life) as well as Architecture Patterns with Python.

**💬 Ask me about** desktop/enterprise programming (Evergreen is a Qt-based desktop application), interfacing with Microsoft Excel/Word from Python, and anything tangential to GIS or commercial real estate.
